Assignment title: Visual promt studio 1.1. 
Promt: Create a contemporary watercolor painting intended to be displayed on a wall in a nature museum as a form of visual protest against bear shooting in Romania, featuring three anthropomorphic bear cubs in the foreground rendered with natural colors and a calm, emotional atmosphere. The central cub has large, sad, wet eyes, wears a simple white headband, and holds a handwritten cardboard sign reading “this is not wildlife management” with a small and frightened posture. The left cub looks toward the viewer with fear and confusion, holding its paws close to its chest protectively. The right cub gazes toward the background as if searching for safety, with ears lowered and body tense and vulnerable. The scene is set against a Romanian submontane landscape in three blended layers where a forest with fir trees and moss and filtered light in natural greens and browns appears slightly melancholic, a small mountain village with red-roofed houses, thin smoke, and a dirt road leading to the forest shows an adult bear searching for food in trash bins, not aggressive but hungry, and a faint urban skyline in the distance suggests human expansion. In the foreground on cold watercolor snow, large parallel tracks of bear and human prints lie close but do not intersect, symbolizing coexistence.
