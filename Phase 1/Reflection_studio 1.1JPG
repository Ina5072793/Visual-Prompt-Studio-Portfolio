Assignment title: Visual promt studio 1.1. 
Promt: Create an unusual painting that will be hung on a wall in a nature museum, as a form of visual protest against bear shooting in Romania. Three anthropomorphic bear cubs in the foreground, painted in a contemporary watercolor mural style with natural colors and a calm, emotional atmosphere. The central cub has large sad wet eyes, a simple white headband, and holds a handwritten cardboard sign saying ‘this is not wildlife management’. Its posture is small and frightened. The left cub looks toward the viewer with fear and confusion, paws held close to the chest protectively. The right cub looks toward the background as if searching for safety, ears lowered, body tense and vulnerable. Behind them, a Romanian submontane landscape in three blended zones: A forest with fir trees, moss, filtered light, natural greens and browns, slightly melancholic. A small mountain village with red-roofed houses, thin smoke, a dirt road leading to the forest; at the edge of the village, an adult bear searches for food in trash bins, not aggressive, just hungry. A distant, faint urban skyline suggesting human expansion. At the bottom, parallel tracks in cold watercolor snow: large bear prints and large human prints, close but not intersecting, symbolizing dangerous proximity.
Vocabulary: Medium-should be a painting with an inscription; main message: an invitation to reflection, to emphasize preservation of nature, prevention not imediate execution, coexistance of humans and wildlife and responsability; representational art; subject matter: Bear cubs as characters at the foot of a mountain, a bear next to a trash bin, with a mountain landscape in the background.
